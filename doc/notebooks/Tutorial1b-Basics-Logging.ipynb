    "## Logging\n",
    "In case of programming problems with the hardware, it can be helpful to get a detailed text output with the processes in the software.  \n",
    "For this purpose, different levels of detail can be set in this text output, so-called log levels. By default, the log level is set to NONE (0). This means that no log is output.  \n",
    "The log levels can have the values 0 to 5. The API provides an enum value for each of these levels.  \n",
    "These are as follows: None_(0), Error(1), Warning(2), Info(3), Debug(4), Trace(5).  \n",
    "If, for example, the LogLevel Info(3) is set, errors, warnings and some useful information are output. If the 'Trace' level is set, even the communication protocol with the hardware is output.  \n",
    "The more detailed the log is, the lower the performance of the engine. You should therefore only switch on (detailed) logging in the event of problems that are not understood or a suspected bug.  \n",
    "There are two types of logging: console logging and file logging. Both can be switched on and configured independently of each other.  \n",
    "The configuration is relatively straightforward and is briefly described below using code examples. "
